    It helped me not to waste my time.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

    It diminishes the risk of remaking the code many times.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: control is on my side. 
    Cons: the risk of loosing a big chunk of work.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git is a spectial tool for programmers who tend to work with
    multiple files at a time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I do not know that yet.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Well, I would rather not to make changes that could break something.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For Android programming.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	You have control over the process.
