What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Stupid question.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I think it helps to split the repository and the working directory.

One more line.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can add and commit files one by one, not all at once.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

New feature, risky changes, alternative or local version of the app.
